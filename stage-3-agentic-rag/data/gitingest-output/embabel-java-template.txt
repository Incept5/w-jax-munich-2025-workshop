# Generated Agent Project

Starting point for your own agent development using the [Embabel framework](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent).

Add your magic here!

Illustrates:

- An injected demo showing how any Spring component can be injected with an Embabel `Ai` instance to enable it to
  perform LLM operations.
- A simple agent
- Unit tests for an agent verifying prompts and hyperparameters

> For the Kotlin equivalent, see
> our [Kotlin agent template](https://github.com/embabel/kotlin-agent-template).

# Running

Run the shell script to start Embabel under Spring Shell:

```bash
./scripts/shell.sh
```

There is a single example
agent, [WriteAndReviewAgent](./src/main/java/com/embabel/template/agent/WriteAndReviewAgent.java).
It uses one LLM with a high temperature and creative persona to write a story based on your input,
then another LLM with a low temperature and different persona to review the story.

When the Embabel shell comes up, invoke the story agent like this:

```
x "Tell me a story about...[your topic]"
```

Try the following other shell commands:

- `demo`: Runs the same agent, invoked programmatically, instead of dynamically based on user input.
  See [DemoCommands.java](./src/main/java/com/embabel/template/DemoShell.java) for the
  implementation.
- `animal`:  Runs a simple demo using an Embabel injected `Ai` instance to call an LLM.
  See [InjectedDemo](./src/main/java/com/embabel/template/injected/InjectedDemo.java).

## Suggested Next Steps

To get a feel for working with Embabel, try the following:

- Modify the prompts in `WriteAndReviewAgent` and `InjectedDemo`.
- Experiment with different models and hyperparameters by modifying `withLlm` calls.
- Integrate your own services, injecting them with Spring. All Embabel `@Agent` classes are Spring beans.
- Run the tests with `mvn test` and modify them to experiment with prompt verification.

To see tool support, check out the more
complex [Embabel Agent API Examples](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent-examples) repository.

## Model support

Embabel integrates with any LLM supported by Spring AI.

See [LLM integration guide](docs/llm-docs.md) (work in progress).

Also see [Spring AI models](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/index.html).

## A2A support

Embabel integrates with Google A2a. See [A2A integration](docs/a2a.md).

FILE: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
================================================
# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
community@embabel.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# A2A Support

Embabel integrates with the [A2A](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A) protocol, allowing you to connect to other
A2A-enabled agents and
services.

> Embabel agents can be exposed to A2A with zero developer effort.

Check out the `a2a` branch of this repository to try A2A support.

You'll need the following environment variable:

- `GOOGLE_STUDIO_API_KEY`: Your Google Studio API key, which is used for Gemini.

Start the Google A2A web interface using Docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Go to the web interface running within the container at `http://localhost:12000/`.

Connect to your agent at `host.docker.internal:8080/a2a`. Note that `localhost:8080/a2a` won't work as the server
cannot access it when running in a Docker container.

Your agent will have automatically been exported to A2A. Add it in the UI, and start a chat.
You should see something like this:

Prompts used by `PromptRunner.withTemplate` or via the `TemplateRenderer` interface
should go in this directory, with a `.jinja` extension.

For example, if you reference `my_prompt` in your code,
you should create a file `my_prompt.jinja` in this directory.
